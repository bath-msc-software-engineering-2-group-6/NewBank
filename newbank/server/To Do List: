Done:
1). Implement Passwords for example clients.
2). Implement basic security features (min and max password length).
Note: (2.) is partially done, need account creation feature and some more tinkering.


To Do:
1). Flag incorrect passwords and have the use repeat the password input.
2). Accept passwords for newly created accounts.
3). Implement more complex password secutirty, enforce the use of special characters and symbols.


Issues:
1). Entering a wrong username is not flagged thus once such a username is entered the result will always produce a loop of 'null.'
2).
